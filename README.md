# Dissertation Presentation Scheduling

***I MADE A CHANGE!***

*We're doing things this way to give you a bit more experience with GitHub, repos, forking, and pull requests (PR).*

**Instructions:** [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository, [pull any updates from the main repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork) ([instructions for doing this via github.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381)), make your updates, and commit as a new branch with a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

*I would encourage you to read the pages linked above so that you understand the process.  A walk-through of the steps is available at [fork-PR-steps.md](fork-PR-steps.md)*

## Dissertation Selection

I want a numbered list of student name, GitHub username, dissertation title, author, year, URL.  Your line should look something like:

Michele Weigle (@weiglemc) - "Providing Location Security in Vehicular Networks", Gongjun Yan, 2010, https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/computerscience_etds/5

Edit the list below:

1. Student 1
1. Student 2

## Scheduling

Once you have selected a dissertation, you may choose a date to present.  To choose a date, copy your line from the selection list above to your chosen date.  

Before you commit, make sure that the formatting is still correct.  The lists below should be numbered, not bullets. Do not add additional entries here, these are the only slots available. Remember that even if you are presenting last, your presentation must be completed by March 31.
